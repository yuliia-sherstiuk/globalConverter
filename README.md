# Global Converter


## Introduction

Gotta Convert 'Em All!' This project aims to create a Java application that allows users to translate messages into different numerical bases.

## Features

- **String Conversion**: The application allows users to translate messages into different numerical bases : octal, hexadecimal, binary, or text.

- **Input Validation**: It checks that the input string contains only alphabetical and/or numerical characters. If the inpu is invalid, an error message is displayed, prompting the uses to enter a string.

- **Base Selection**: Users can choose the desired conversion base. If the entered base is invalid, an error message is shown.

- **Reversible Conversion**: Any conversion can be reversed, allowing for bidirectional translation.

- **Encryption and Decryption**: The application incorporates a simple encryption algorithm, Caesar cipher. Users can specify the desired encryption key.

## Command Line Options

The following options are available to run the program:

- To convert to hexadecimal: '-h' or 'hexadecimal'
- To convert to octal: '-o' or 'octal'
- To convert to decimal: '-d' or 'decimal'
- To convert to binary: '-b' or 'binary'
- To convert to text: '-t' or 'text

## Project Structure

The project is organizes into several classes for better modularity and readability:
 - **Main**: The main class to run the application.
 - **Converter**: The class responsible for conversions between different bases.
 - **Validator**: The class for validating user inputs.
 - **Cipher**: The class for managing the encryption and decryption of strings.
